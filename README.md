## FAQ
**Why does my Anti-Virus detect NekoBox as malware?** <br/>
NekoBox's built-in update functionallity downloads the new release, removes the old files and replaces them with the new ones, which is quite simliar to what malwares do, remove your files and replace them with an encrypted version of your files.
Also the `System DNS` feature will change your system's DNS settings, which is also considered a dangerous action by some Anti-Virus applications.

**I got the msvcp140.dll not found error on windows** <br/>
The "msvcp140.dll not found" error usually means that the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is missing or corrupted. To fix this, try install or reinstall the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable from the official Microsoft website
[Official Microsoft website for Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)

**Does NekoBox really need to be run in UAC mode on Windows?** <br/>
No, that is not necessary. NekoBox restarts nekobox_core in UAC mode if TUN mode is selected and NekoBox is not already running with administrator privileges. NekoBox requests UAC confirmation to restart the core.

**Is setting the `SUID` bit really needed on Linux?** <br/>
No, it is not needed, but if `SUID` does not configured properly, the NekoBox will ask for administrator password to order to restart nekobox_core with administrator privilegies, if TUN mode is selected and NekoBox is not already running as root. NekoBox will ask for password for once, and will not configure `SUID`.

**Why does my internet stop working after I force quit NekoBox?** <br/>
If NekoBox is force-quit while `System proxy` is enabled, the process ends immediately and NekoBox cannot reset the proxy. <br/>
Solution:
- Always close NekoBox normally.
- If you force quit by accident, open nekobox again, enable `System proxy`, then disable it- this will reset the settings.

**Why NekoBox uses Noto emoji instead of Twitter emoji? What differences between them two?** <br/>
  Noto Emoji is part of the Noto font family developed by Google. It aims for a clean, simple, and consistent design across various platforms, emphasizing legibility. It is often used in Android systems and Google services. Noto Emoji is designed to support a wide range of characters and symbols, making it suitable for diverse languages and scripts. Also, Noto Emoji is open source, which allows developers to use and modify it freely in their applications.

  Twitter Emoji, also known as Twemoji, has a more colorful and stylized design. It often features more expressive and characterful designs compared to Noto. These emojis are primarily used on Twitter and other platforms where Twitterâ€™s branding is applied. They are designed for use in tweets, direct messages, and other Twitter communications. While Twemoji can be used elsewhere, it is specifically tailored for the Twitter platform, emphasizing a cohesive user experience within Twitter's ecosystem.

  Noto emoji provides better system integration and is part of the larger Noto fonts project, which aims to support all emoji characters defined in Unicode. Generally, Noto emoji are smaller than Twitter emoji. NekoBox does use Noto emoji font because we prefer better system integration over specific stylized design. The Throne project does not care about system integration at all.
